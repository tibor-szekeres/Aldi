# Aldi
This is the Repository of Szekeres Tibor for the application at Aldi. 

Please find the solution for Tasks 1 through 2 in AldiTC.xlsx file. 
cypress folder contains the solution for FrontEnd testing task and the API java file contains the solution for the RestAssured task. 

Bonus questions:  
Docker: I only ever used docker-compose up in previous jobs, but after looking into I tried a solution.

CI Integration: I have used Jenkins and Gitlab earlier as a CI/CD tool. Jenkins UI has a plugin for Cypress tests that can basically import the repository and tests easily where you can maintain these jobs and schedule the runs also.
